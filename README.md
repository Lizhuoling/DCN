This is a simplified demo of this paper "Deep Learning based Densely Connected  Network for Load Forecasting". The training and validation data is the Australia dataset in this paper. It covers the period between 2011 to 2016.

##Environment requirement
This code is implemented on the Ubuntu 17 system using Python2. If you want to run it with Python3. You should bridge the grammar gap between Python2 and Python3 by yourself. For example, the print in Python2 is
```
print 'hello world'
```
If in Python3, it should be
```
print('hello world')
```
In addition, the required libraries should be installed, such as tensorflow, keras, numpy, opencv, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy. You can use the following comand to install it in the Linux system.
```
sudo pip install + "library name"
```
